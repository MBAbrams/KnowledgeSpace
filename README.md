Requirement: PHP 5
Framework: CodeIgniter-3.0.3

The KS utilizes the CodeIgniter to the maintain the Model View Controller(MVC) structure. For example, the URL such as
/SciCrunchKS/index.php/pages/view/pyramidal_cell will first access the controllers/Pages.php and then the view function in the class. The Pages class extends CI_Controller, which is the controller in the MVC structure. 

The PHP file at /controllers/JsonClientUtil.php contains all utility functions for accessing the data through the REST API.
